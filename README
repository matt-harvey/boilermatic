OVERVIEW

Boilermatic is small C++ code-generation tool with a graphical user
interface. It is intended to automate some of the repetitive tasks
associated with creating a new class in C++11.


DEPENDENCIES

Boilermatic requires:

-	A Tcl interpreter;
-	Tk; and
-	Ttk.

Boilermatic has been tested with tclsh8.5 only; however, it is likely
to work with other Tcl interpreters.

Tk and Ttk are Tcl packages that are likely to be available on most
systems on which tclsh8.5 is installed.


INSTALLATION

-- Unix-like systems --

cd into the source directory, and enter the following sequence of commands:

	chmod +x install.tcl
	sudo ./install.tcl

This will install Boilermatic to /usr/local/bin.
To install it to a different location, open "install.tcl" in a text editor
and change the install_destination variable to the desired location.

To run Boilermatic, simply enter "boilermatic" at the command line.
It is generally most convenient if you run it from within the project
directory of your C++ project, as the suggested location for saving the
generated C++ files will default to the current working directory.

If you have trouble running the script, try changing the first
line in "boilermatic.tcl" to one of the following, and reinstalling.
 
	#!/usr/bin/env wish
 	#!/usr/bin/env tclsh8.5
	#!/usr/bin/wish
	#!/usr/bin/tclsh
	#!/usr/bin/tclsh8.5


-- Windows --

Manually copy the file "boilermatic.tcl" to a directory of your choosing.
Add this directory to your %PATH% if it is not in your %PATH% already.

You may need to associate the file "boilermatic.tcl" with wish or another Tcl
interpreter. You should then be able to run it either by entering
"boilermatic" at the command line, or by double-clicking the script's icon
in Windows Explorer.
